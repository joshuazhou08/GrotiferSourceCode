### Attitude Control 
With realtime multitasking, PI control loops, and sensors, this code can run on the Grotifer satellite to detumble, find sun, and move to certain locations all the while actuating the TORPs (twin orthogonal rotating panels) with sensors attached.

This allows for measuring electric fields in 3D.
